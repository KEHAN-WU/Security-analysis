  <h1>üîç Security Incidents: Visual & Statistical Story</h1>
  <p>This interactive narrative visualizes key insights from a security incidents dataset. The report integrates exploratory data analysis, regression, and classification to reveal patterns and model performance.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Figure 1</h2>
      <img src="assets/figures/fig1.png" alt="Figure 1">
      <p>This project explores security incidents data from 2000 to 2023, aiming to uncover trends, assess casualty patterns, and develop predictive models. Key research questions include temporal dynamics, casualty correlations, and classification of incident verification status.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Figure 2</h2>
      <img src="assets/figures/fig2.png" alt="Figure 2">
      <p>The histogram shows incidents increasing from 2000 to 2015, dipping in 2016‚Äì2017, and rising again post-2018. This may reflect social or policy-driven fluctuations in stability or reporting.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Figure 3</h2>
      <img src="assets/figures/fig3.png" alt="Figure 3">
      <p>Monthly analysis suggests minor seasonal variation, with slightly elevated incidents in June and July. This mid-year increase could relate to climatic, political, or operational cycles.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Figure 4</h2>
      <img src="assets/figures/fig4.png" alt="Figure 4">
      <p>Distributions of casualties (killed, wounded, affected) are highly skewed. While most incidents are minor, a few account for disproportionately high losses, indicating severe events.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Figure 5</h2>
      <img src="assets/figures/fig5.png" alt="Figure 5">
      <p>A scatter matrix reveals weak correlations between time-based features and casualties, but strong relationships among Total killed, Total wounded, and Total affected ‚Äî suggesting potential for dimensionality reduction.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Figure 6</h2>
      <img src="assets/figures/fig6.png" alt="Figure 6">
      <p>Boxplots confirm the presence of extreme outliers in casualty metrics, which likely represent mass-scale or exceptional events and deserve further investigation or separate treatment.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Figure 7</h2>
      <img src="assets/figures/fig7.png" alt="Figure 7">
      <p>A linear regression model predicts Total affected using numerical features. Residuals are well-distributed, and 'Log_Total_Affected' proves most important, followed by Total killed and wounded.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Figure 8</h2>
      <img src="assets/figures/fig8.png" alt="Figure 8">
      <p>The workflow diagram illustrates a typical data science pipeline used: cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, and storytelling. It frames the project and validates applied methods.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Figure 9</h2>
      <img src="assets/figures/fig9.png" alt="Figure 9">
      <p>The correlation heatmap reveals feature clusters: casualty metrics align tightly, while time and verification features exhibit weaker relationships ‚Äî confirming modeling assumptions.</p>
